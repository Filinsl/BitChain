# BitChain

## 📖 Project Description

**BitChain** is a system where each user sends a specified amount to a designated wallet. After the transaction is confirmed, the user's address appears on the main page with the doubled amount. The next user who sends funds transfers the already doubled amount from the previous user, and their address is also added to the chain.

Thus, the system automatically redistributes funds among participants in a queue. Everything is completely transparent: each transaction can be verified on the blockchain, and the display on the main page ensures that no one is overlooked. Registration is not required — everything works through wallet addresses.
